Hey!
I'm Logan - A full-time Software Developer at Amwins Group Inc. in South Park (an insurance company) since June of 2023
I was hired out of an internship despite not having my degree finished, so I'm currently back with a lot more knowledge to get me a lil well-deserved raise 
I’ll be honest — I haven’t gone through much of the training material since I’m already comfortable with this stuff (see tech stack below). Instead, I’m sticking to the Project Description’s limitations
Instead of Jquery or an ASPX (html/js in one file) structure like i'm used to, I used the js files to do some DOM manipulation so I can just have an array there instead of in the HTML file
**UPDATE: nevermind, no Scripting in the HTML file (at least yet, I assume), y'all wanted the header pasted on each file individally and the items listed in the HTML - refactored based on that, no DOM manipulation yet

Tech Stack/Expertise:
    Frontend: Jquery/ Regular Javascript/Rarely Typescript / Telerik controls (the bane of my existence, very dated)
    Backend: .NET, API Development, Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL & Stored Procedures)

This Project:
    Powerify, imaginary shop with DNA modifications (Genomes) you can take to give yourself super powers, based on heroes or abilities
    Current "Genomes": 
        Lightning - The Flash/Quicksilver based Super Speed
        Healing Factor - Wolverine/Deadpool based healing factor (no claws obv)
        Arcane Enhancement - Think just giving the user the ability to cast arcane spells, tap into the arcane like a WoW Arcane Mage
        Waterbreather - Aquaman-like gills and faster swim speed - no fish talking
        Colossal - Toggleable Metal Skin like Colossus
        Super Soldier - Captain America/Bucky-style Stamina, Stength, and Agility

I did create a git repo for this, as I coded from my work computer and my personal computer
