Hey!
I'm Logan - A full-time Software Developer at Amwins Group Inc. in South Park (an insurance company) since June of 2023
I was hired out of an internship despite not having my degree finished, so I'm currently back with a lot more knowledge to get me a lil well-deserved raise 

Tech Stack/Expertise:
    Frontend: Jquery/ Regular Javascript/Rarely Typescript / Telerik controls (the bane of my existence, very dated)
    Backend: .NET, API Development, Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL & Stored Procedures)

This Project:
    Powerify, imaginary shop with DNA modifications (Genomes) you can take to give yourself super powers, based on heroes or abilities
    Current "Genomes": 
        Lightning - The Flash/Quicksilver based Super Speed
        Healing Factor - Wolverine/Deadpool based healing factor (no claws obv)
        Arcane Enhancement - Think just giving the user the ability to cast arcane spells, tap into the arcane like a WoW Arcane Mage
        Waterbreather - Aquaman-like gills and faster swim speed - no fish talking
        Colossal - Toggleable Metal Skin like Colossus
        Super Soldier - Captain America/Bucky-style Stamina, Stength, and Agility

I did create a git repo for this, as I coded from my work computer and my personal computer
